The purpose of this assignment was to better understand the use of LP programming in relation to network models,
more specifically using LP as a method for finding the critical path in project management. Using python PuLP 
environment we were able to create model the project through nodes and arcs in a directed graph diagram and using
the associated costs for each path as our model constraints. Then, minimizing our objective function, our optimal
solution ends up being the critical path length. 

Located in this repository are all related documents and graphs that were used in creating and model our project.
